## 📖 Story Behind This Project  

I wanted to test myself by recreating the **Sundown Studio** website.  
No fancy frameworks, no shortcuts — just **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

Along the way, I learned how important **small details** are in design.  
The smooth scrolling effect you’ll notice comes from **Locomotive JS** — a simple tool that makes scrolling feel alive.  

This project is not about perfection, it’s about practice.  
Breaking down the original design and slowly piecing it back together helped me understand **how real websites are built**.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML** → structure  
- **CSS** → styling & layouts  
- **Locomotive JS** → smooth scrolling animations

## 🙏 Special Thanks
This project wouldn’t exist without inspiration and guidance from:  
- **Sheriyans Coding School**  
- **Sarthak Sharma**

## 🌟 What’s Next?
Every project teaches something new. This one reminded me that:  
> "The best way to learn development is not by watching… but by *building*."  

So if you’re learning too, try recreating sites you admire. You’ll discover a lot more than tutorials can show.
